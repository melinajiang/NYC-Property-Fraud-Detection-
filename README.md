# NYC-Property-Fraud-Detection

The purpose of this project is to look for potential fraudulent properties in  "NYC Property Valuation and Assessment Data" file, using two unsupervised machine learning models. Our team investigated 10 records with the highest fraud score to demonstrated our algorithm works properly. 

The steps we took for this project: <br>
• Exam 1M records and build model to discern potential property fraud.

• Generated 45 features from 1M records and employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality of
variables from 45 to 6, with 90% variance remaining

• Applied Heuristic Algorithm and Autoencoder to build two unsupervised models to find potential fraudulent records
